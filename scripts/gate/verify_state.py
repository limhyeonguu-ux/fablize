"""Stop-time decision for the fablize observation gate.

The decision is made purely from observed ledger state — never from the
assistant's claim text — so it is language-agnostic. It blocks a non-quick,
non-docs task that changed files but has no OBSERVED successful verification.
This catches "I changed code and tests pass" when no test was ever run, or ran
and failed. Complementary to finish-the-work.sh (which catches promise-no-act).
